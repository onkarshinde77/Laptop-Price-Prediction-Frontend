## ⚙️ Tech Stack

**Frontend**
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- Toast notifications and loading spinner

**Backend**
- Python (Flask)
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Pickled ML model (`pipe.pkl`)

## 🏗️ How It Works

1. User enters the laptop configuration.
2. The frontend calculates additional parameters like PPI.
3. Sends data to Flask backend via API.
4. Trained ML model processes the input.
5. Returns the predicted price to frontend.

## 🛠️ Setup & Installation

### 📦 Backend (Flask + ML Model)

cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py

cd frontend
run HTML file on live server using `Go Live`


🧪 Model Training
The model is trained on a dataset of laptop specifications and prices using a Pipeline with:

Label Encoding

Feature Transformation

Regression Algorithm (e.g., RandomForestRegressor)
